Software Development on SAP HANA (Update Q1/2019)
openSAP HANA7 Course Exercise Materials - Updated for SAP Cloud Platform, HANA As A Service, and SAP Web IDE Full-stack (July 2019)

## Course Summary
With the delivery of SAP HANA 2.0, we see many new features in both the underlying SAP HANA infrastructure and in the custom development aspects of SAP HANA native development.

Although we have two previous courses that focused on these new technologies – SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA to develop both HDI (SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure) and XSA (SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model) – they could only cover the basics due to so much new functionality. In this course, we’ll start from the assumption that students are familiar with the basics of the previous courses. This will allow us to dive deeper on key topics from real world applications. We’ll also cover new functionality added in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 03 and 04, especially the evolution of the core programming model in XSA/Cloud Foundry.

Developers taking this course should be able to get up to speed quickly and begin leveraging these new features to enhance their own productivity, as well as tap into powerful new features of SAP HANA itself. Students will learn how to use SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA or SAP Web IDE full-stack to develop both HDI and XSA/CF-based applications for SAP HANA on-premise or on SAP Cloud Platform.

We’ll also focus on real-world problems and opportunities such as:
- Cross-container and external reporting tool access to containers
- Realistic yet easier-to-maintain security setup
- The power of modern programming models
- SQL DDL-based database object creation
- New Core Data & Servces concepts for service enablement and UI annotations
- More open source components and techniques

## Course Content
Week 1: What’s New in SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 03

Week 2: New Programming Model

Week 3: Open Technologies and Concepts

Week 4: Final Exam

## Target Audience
Application developers
SAP HANA developers
SAP Cloud Platform developers

## Course Requirements
Basic programming knowledge including HTML, JavaScript, and SQL
Baseline SAP HANA development knowledge from one of the previous SAP HANA courses on openSAP would be helpful

## Development Systems
If your primary interest in taking this course is getting an overview of software development on SAP HANA, you do not need access to a training system. However, we realize that many of you will be interested in completing the hands-on exercises based on the instructions in the course. We’ll therefore provide the necessary instructions and installation procedures in the respective units.

The exercises in this course in this version/branch are primarily designed so that you can execute them on SAP Cloud Platform and HANA As A Service as of July 2019. This means SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 04.
